You are continuing a coding task initiated by a previous agent.
The goal is to maintain a simple encrypted backup tool (`backup.sh`).

# Context
We have created a bash script `backup.sh` that:
1. Compresses a source directory using `tar`.
2. Encrypts the archive using `gpg` with a Public Key.
3. Adds a timestamp to the filename.
4. Manages retention (deletes backups older than 7 days).
5. detailed restore instructions are in the script header.

# Current State
- **Workspace**: `/home/markom/src/backup-docker`
- **Script**: `backup.sh`
    - **Behavior**: Silent on success (exit 0), prints errors to stderr (exit non-zero).
    - **Retention**: 7 days (checks after successful backup).
    - **Encryption**: Uses GPG key for `markom@gmail.com`.
- **Git Repository**: Initialized. Remote: `https://github.com/icemarkom/backup-docker`.
- **Artifacts**:
    - `walkthrough.md`: detailed usage and restore guide.

# Next Steps
- Validate the script in a real environment (cron).
- Push to GitHub (requires authentication setup).
